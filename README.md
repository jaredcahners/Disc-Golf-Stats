# Disc-Golf-Stats
My analysis of disc golf data scraped from PDGA.com.

## Parts that I Find Particularly Cool
1) My power rankings play a central part of this analysis and I am constantly tweeking them. It has been fun trying to mathematically determine who's the best, especially as my rankings differ so substantially from others.
2) I'm also working on my "head-to-head" too. Name two players and bring up their stats against eachother and other fun stats about their playing relationship. 

## The Learning Journey
1) I scraped a bunch of player information, placed it in a dataframe. Then I would scrape tournament info. To put the tournament info into the dataframe was a pretty arduous process with a lot of input needed to be done. When I closed my notebook, and opened it again, I would have to rescrape everything.
2) Instead of rescraping I saved html docs on my computer to parse.
3) Slowly I automated more and more of the tournament input process using text formatting.
4) I realized that instead of continually scraping, it was better to keep my data in a database on my computer. So saving the data became a regular part of tournament entry.
5) I started doing analysis with more complex code. These hunks of code sat in my notebook. My notebook started getting very long.
6) More and more of the tournament entry became automated. Life got better.
7) I began version 2... I decided to remake the project to be more object-oriented, than the "dataframe-oriented" form it had before. Tournaments and players became objects with attributes and methods. Because, that makes sense. And now tournament entry is a very fast, simple process.
8) I focussed on using functions because of reusability. This reduced the amount of code and simplified it. This also has kept my notebook at a reasonable size.
9) We will see... 


Enjoy!
